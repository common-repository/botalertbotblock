== ChangeLog ==

= Version 1.0.1 =
* dropped one round-trip to BotAlert/BotBlock servers, thus making the plugin faster.
* added support for non-javascript browsers, incl. a new setting
* several configuration improvements, incl. a requirements test for cURL
= Version 1.0.0 =
* changed data flow to go through plugin: BotAlert/BotBlock Javascript passes through plugin when loaded and results are submitted through plugin for validation. Before, both were done through the client's browser directly and thus not always reliable.
= Version 0.9.6 =
* first version on wordpress.org
* cleaned up
* added auto-wiring
= Version 0.9.5 =
* first public version
